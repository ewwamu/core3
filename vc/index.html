                The Vintage Collection focuses on New York City's informal sitting 
                spaces in history. The pictures are sourced from the NYPL's 
                Picture Collection, and many of the folders I pulled these images 
                from were titled, "New York City - Life". I was taken by this 
                 because I found it reflected a very interesting part of our 
                culture, in which we enjoy loitering, schmoozing, and hanging about 
                in places that weren't made for that purpose. The pictures themselves 
                are also incredibly captivating, many of them taken in portraiture, 
                which I wasn't able to do.
