                Standpipes are right up there with hydrants in terms of
                popularity and accessibility. In fact, many would say they prefer 
                the standpipe, as its wide top provides ample surface area 
                for one's tush. At the perfect sitting height and high frequency 
                along the sidewalks, I am happy to agree with the many. 
                Thus, it is equally as unfortunate that I must report: these "chairs" are 
                also being taken away.
                <br>
                <br>
                On streets and sidewalks with busy foot traffic, you may notice 
                that these seats are now covered by threatening and morose cages of 
                spikes. Though their official purpose it to keep the city's pests 
                away, it's easy to see the true, more sinister reason; that is, to be 
                as uninviting and inaccessible as possible. We slowly find ourselves 
                with less and less spaces to occupy in nonconsumer ways, to meet and connect
                and take breaks, and its disheartening. However, I also believe in the 
                unconventional and wonderful places New Yorkers will find to rest.
