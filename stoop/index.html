            <p>
                Of these unconventional "chairs", I find that stoops are 
                where people tend to congregate the most. It is easy to walk 
                by a stoop full of people conversing or eating, having a 
                quiet moment to themselves. There is a profound sense of community 
                and comradery between neighbors. However, there are many who don't share 
                the same sentiment. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Of course, those who live in the building of the stoop have a hard 
                time welcoming the large groups who take up all the space surrounding 
                the entrance, and many of these sitters are comfortable with leaving 
                their trash and cigarette butts upon the steps. Many have taken to 
                installing a fence, or putting up a "Private Property" sign in hopes of 
                keeping these hordes away, but New Yorkers, ever a cheeky and rule-breaking 
                bunch, keep coming back.
