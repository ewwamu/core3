                Despite New York City being one of the most population dense cities of America,
                places to leisurely rest and sit and few and far between. Why is that?
                I think <i>Please, Just a Nice Place to Sit</i>, an article from the <i>New York Times</i>,
                provides the reason, or at least one, plain and clear. The quote is as follows:
            </p>
            <div class="nyt-quote">
                "But there are still few places to sit — and not entirely by accident, either. 
                Some builders genuinely and sincerely mistrust people — noncustomer people, 
                at least—and are almost obsessive on the threat of hippies."
            </div>
            <p>
                There is some outdated language being used(I mean, "hippies"?), but points out how NYC's infrastructure
                is not made to support leisurely rest, thus why this unconventional collection came into
                being. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Fire hydrants are byfar one of the most popular places to sit, no matter how uncomfortable
                it may be. I saw many resting for a smoke, to pause inbetween destinations, and even
                to take a short lunch break. Its both an impressive and humorous representation of New York City's
                personality and community, as well as a byproduct of a larger issue on city planning and design
                that needs to be addressed.
